""" Simple utility module for starting DBUS services.

    This function is used to start a service that exports a DBUS object. If the
    DBUS object can be found already, nothing is done and the function returns
    True. Otherwise we try to start the given script file and wait until we
    receive a newline over stdout.

    The "wait for newline" mechanism ensures any function calling this one will
    not try to access the object via DBUS until it is ready. It is recommended
    to use something like

    glib.idle_add(sys.stdout.write, "Started service\n")
    glib.idle_add(sys.stdout.flush)
    mainloop.run()

    That way a newline will be sent when the mainloop is started.

    @param script_file: the Python script file to run if the DBUS object does
                        not already exist
    @type script_file: a Python script file that will create the DBUS object and
                       send a newline over stdout when it is ready

    @param dbus_service_name: the name of the DBUS service to request
    @type dbus_service_name: string (confirming to the DBUS service format)

    @param dbus_object_path: the DBUS object path to request
    @type dbus_object_path: string (confirming to the DBUS object path format)

    @rtype: boolean
    @return: Whether or not the service was successfully started.
