RabbitVCS Thunar Gtk+3 Extension

This extension is meant to be used with the Thunar File Manager v1.7 or higher.
As of the v1.7 release, Thunar requires Gtk+3 and allows for Python3, so this
client makes sure it can work with both. Bear in mind that
Thunar's extension framework still does not allow the setting of emblems so file statuses
will not be overlayed like they do on Nautilus.

Requirements:
    * thunar (>= v1.7)
    * thunarx-python (>= v0.5.0)
    * dbus-python (>= 0.80)
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install:
    Copy RabbitVCS.py to one of:
        1. $XDG_DATA_HOME/thunarx-python/extensions (i.e. ~/.local)
        2. thunar_prefix/share/thunarx-python/extensions (i.e. ~/Development/Thunar)
        3. $XDG_DATA_DIRS/thunarx-python/extensions (i.e. /usr/share)
        4. THUNARX_EXTENSION_DIR/python (i.e. /usr/lib64/thunarx-3/python)

    In both cases, you may need to create the python folder.
    Some systems like Fedora use /usr/lib64 on 64-bit systems.
