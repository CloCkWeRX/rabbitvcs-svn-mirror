RabbitVCS Thunar Extension

This extension is meant to be used with the Thunar File Manager,

Requirements:
    * thunar (>= v0.4.0)
    * thunarx-python (>= v0.2.0)
    * dbus-python (>= 0.80)
    * (all other RabbitVCS requirements)

To install:
    If you are running Thunar v1.1.0 or later, copy RabbitVCS.py to:
        /usr/lib/thunarx-2/python or /usr/lib64/thunarx-2/python
    
    If you are running Thunar < v1.1.0, copy RabbitVCS.py to:
        /usr/lib/thunarx-1/python or /usr/lib64/thunarx-2/python
        
    In both cases, you may need to create the python folder.  Some systems like Fedora use /usr/lib64 on 64-bit systems.
